# 📚 Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **online learning portfolio**!  
This repository is where I keep track of the courses, certifications, and trainings I’ve completed. My goal is to document my progress, share what I’ve learned, and showcase the skills I’m building for future projects and opportunities.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- Serve as a **living CV** of my continuous learning.  
- Share summaries, key takeaways, and certificates from each course.  
- Connect learning outcomes to my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/danivapp).  

## 🗂️ Structure  
Each entry includes:  
- **Course Name & Provider** (Coursera, edX, Udemy, etc.)  
- **Completion Date**  
- **Certificate Link** (if available)  
- **Key Learnings / Skills Gained**  

## 🚀 Why this repo?  
I believe learning is a continuous process. By keeping a transparent record here, I can not only reflect on my growth but also give potential collaborators and employers insight into my background.
